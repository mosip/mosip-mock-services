# Mock Biometric SDK



# MockSDK

The **MockSDK** repository provides a mock implementation of [IBioAPIV2](https://github.com/mosip/bio-utils/blob/master/kernel-biometrics-api/src/main/java/io/mosip/kernel/biometrics/spi/IBioApiV2.java) to perform 1:N match, segmentation, extraction, quality, converter etc.It simulates interactions with SDK components and is designed for testing and integration within the MOSIP ecosystem.
