# Mock Biometric SDK

## 📌 Overview
The **MockSDK** repository provides a mock implementation of [IBioAPIV2](https://github.com/mosip/bio-utils/blob/master/kernel-biometrics-api/src/main/java/io/mosip/kernel/biometrics/spi/IBioApiV2.java) to perform 1:N match, segmentation, extraction, quality, converter etc. It simulates interactions with SDK components and is designed for testing and integration within the MOSIP ecosystem.

## ✨ Features
-   **Biometric Operations**: Simulates 1:N matching, segmentation, extraction, and quality checks.
-   **Format Conversion**: Supports mock conversion between biometric formats.
-   **Standard Compliance**: Implements the `IBioApiV2` interface as per MOSIP specifications.
-   **Unit Testing**: Ideal for mocking biometric operations during unit and integration testing.

## 🛠️ Services
-   **SampleSDKV2**: The main implementation class (`io.mosip.mock.sdk.impl.SampleSDKV2`) that provides the mock functionality.

## ⚙️ Local Setup
Since `mock-sdk` is a library, setting it up involves building it and including it as a dependency in your project.

## 📋 Pre requisites
Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:
-   **Java**: Version 21.0.3
-   **Maven**: For building the project
-   **Git**: To clone the repository
-   **Postman (optional)**: For testing the APIs

## 🗄️ Database Setup
-   **Not Applicable**: This module is a stateless library and does not require a database.

### Running the Application
Used as reference implementation for [biosdk-services](https://github.com/mosip/biosdk-services).

In `biosdk-services`, the below values are required for mockSDK implementation:
```properties
biosdk_class=io.mosip.mock.sdk.impl.SampleSDKV2
mosip.role.biosdk.getservicestatus=REGISTRATION_PROCESSOR
biosdk_bioapi_impl=io.mosip.mock.sdk.impl.SampleSDKV2
```

## 🏗️ Build locally
To build the library locally:

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mosip/mosip-mock-services.git
    cd mosip-mock-services/mock-sdk
    ```

2.  **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install -Dgpg.skip=true
    ```
    This will install the `mock-sdk` JAR into your local Maven repository.

## 🚀 Deployment
-   **Not Applicable**: This module is a library jar and is not deployed as a standalone service. It is used as a dependency in other services.

## ⬆️ Upgrade
To upgrade:
1.  Git pull latest changes.
2.  Update dependencies in `pom.xml`.
3.  Rebuild: `mvn clean install`.
